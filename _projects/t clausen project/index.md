When tasked with an open-ended project for Advanced Engineering Mechanics, two other students and I drew inspiration from our professor's research. He published a paper investigating the mechanics and shape of the skeletal elements in the marine sponge Tethya Aurantia. The paper found that a tapered shape significantly enhances the spicules' ability to withstand buckling, presenting a unique strategy not commonly observed in man-made structures. The Strongyloxea (silica rods) most closely resemble a Clausen column.
<br>Hence, the basis for our project: How does the critical buckling load of a Clausen column compare to that of a traditional cylindrical column? 
<br>While my partners focused on CAD models for 3D printing, I worked with stress equations and evaluated the limitations of Lagrange's original determination of the cylinder as the strongest column. The Clausen column was determined to be 33% stronger than the cylindrical column.
