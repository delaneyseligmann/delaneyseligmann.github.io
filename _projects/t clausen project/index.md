## Summary
When tasked with an open-ended project for Advanced Engineering Mechanics, two other students and I drew inspiration from our professor's research. He published a paper investigating the mechanics and shape of the skeletal elements in the marine sponge Tethya Aurantia. The paper found that a tapered shape significantly enhances the spicules' ability to withstand buckling, presenting a unique strategy not commonly observed in man-made structures. The Strongyloxea (silica rods) most closely resemble a Clausen column.
