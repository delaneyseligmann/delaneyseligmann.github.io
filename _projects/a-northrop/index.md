While awaiting statement of work (ability to hop on certain projects), I spend 50% of my time as a Contamination Control Engineer (CCE), mainly supporting NG OPIR Polar. The other 50% of my time is spent supporting an attitude control systems (ACS) flight software (FSW) auto-coding project, turning guidance, navigation, & control (GNC) MATLAB code to FSW C/C++.
