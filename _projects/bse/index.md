In April 2021, NASA agreed to provide launch space on a future rocket for a satellite designed and built by Brown University students to test the performance of next-generation solar cells in space. The mission, known as PVDX (Perovskite Visuals and Degradation eXperiment), also includes an educational outreach component for K–12 students. Participating students can send short messages to the satellite, which are displayed on an onboard LED panel. A camera mounted on an articulated arm then photographs the display against the backdrop of Earth from orbit, and the image is transmitted back to the students from space.

I joined BSE spring of my freshman year in 2021. My main focus was prototyping the mechanical arm and iterating through different spring designs in solidworks, prior to our switch to onshape after gaining their sponsorship.

At the start of my junior year, fall 2023, I took on the role as testing lead. A setup had to be designed to test the arm and we were nearing the point for environmental testing.
