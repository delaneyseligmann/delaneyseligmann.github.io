In April 2021, NASA agreed to provide launch space on a future rocket for a satellite designed and built by Brown University students to test the performance of next-generation solar cells in space. The mission, known as PVDX (Perovskite Visuals and Degradation eXperiment), also includes an educational outreach component for K–12 students. Participating students can send short messages to the satellite, which are displayed on an onboard LED panel. A camera mounted on an articulated arm then photographs the display against the backdrop of Earth from orbit, and the image is transmitted back to the students from space.

I joined BSE spring of my freshman year in 2021. My main focus was prototyping the mechanical arm and iterating through different spring designs in solidworks, prior to our switch to onshape after gaining their sponsorship. Prototyping ranged from 3D printing to modelling with magnetic building toys. I also worked on implementing geometric dimensioning and toleranceing (gd&t) to the drawings of structual components for machining and final presentation.

At the start of my junior year, fall 2023, I took on the role as testing lead. Responsibilities included determining necessary test levels, creating a test setup for arm functionality in both ambient and vacuum, and coordinating with different points of contact for testing fascilities. Though we were able to coordinate a suitable thermal vacuum chamber through a research lab on campus, we failed to find an affordable and convenient means for vibration testing. When in doubt, build your own!
