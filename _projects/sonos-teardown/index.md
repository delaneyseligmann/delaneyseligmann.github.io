## Thermal Profile Tool  
Wrote a Python application to replace the former tedious method of generating thermal profiles for thermal cycle test procedures. The application allows environmental test engineers to select their level of testing (protoqualification, qualification, acceptance), required temperatures, and other parameters to generate the necessary profile and labels. The application cut the lengthy process from 4 hours to 1 minute.

## Thermal Data Automation Tool
Developed a Python application to accelerate data processing for technicians after finishing a thermal vacuum/cycle test. Before the application, technicians manually organized and labeled a high volume of raw data into folders for further use. This process took 1-2 days. Running the application automatically sorts the data and allows the technicians to label folders as they desire, shortening the process to 2 minutes.

## Test Procedures
Authored test plans and procedures for MIL-STD-1540, GSFC-STD-7000A, and SMC-S-016 based vibration, shock, thermal, and thermal vacuum environmental testing. The procedures were for various satellite components and were created in either Manufacturo or Microsoft Word.
